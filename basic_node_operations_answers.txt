1. 
- Sort alphabetically sorts out each line of a file considering whitespace as well. 
- wc prints out 35 as a new line count, 72 as a word count and 772 as a byte count.
- uniq printed out all the lines in the file because all lines are unique.

2. I piped sort commands.js with uniq => sort commands | uniq and it outputted basically the same results as sort commands because all lines are unique.

```
var input = "I'm learning to program algorithms!";

function reverseString(inputString) { 
  var inputArr = inputString.split(' ');
  var outputArr = [];
  
  inputArr.forEach((word) => {
    var wordArr = word.split('');
    wordArr.reverse();
    word = wordArr.join('');
    outputArr.push(word);
  });
  
  outputString = outputArr.join(' ');
  return outputString;
}

console.log(reverseString(input));
```
